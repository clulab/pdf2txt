# pdf2txt-textract

In order to use this converter, you will need to have [credentials](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/dc-integration-creation-app-cdn/main.html?api=pdf-services-api) from Adobe for the PDF Extract API.  They will include files usually called `pdfservices-api-credentials.json` and `private.key`.  The location of the former defaults in `pdf2txt.conf` to `${user.home}/.pdf2txt/pdfservices-api-credentials.json`.  If need be, you can change it in that file or just specify a different configuration file (e.g., as a command line argument to `pdf2txt`) that contains a different value for `Pdf2txt.adobeCredentials` so that it points to your credentials.  The latter private key file, is in turn specified in the credentials file.  Please use an absolute path for the `private_key_file` value.
